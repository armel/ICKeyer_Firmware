**First of all, many thanks to all my [donors](#donations)üôèüèª** 

The ICKeyer project allows the IC-705, IC-7300 and IC-9700 produced by ICOM to be equipped with an external touch keyer. This allows you to dedicate the IC screen to the Waterfall while having your Keyer on the M5Stack screen.

# Beta test

For the moment, this project is in private beta test only. 

# Features

The ICKeyer support Voice and CW memories. It allows you to call up the 8 memories stored in the transceiver. 

It is possible to change the transmit mode directly from the central button of the keyer (FM, USB, LSB, CW).

![USB](https://github.com/armel/ICKeyer_Firmware/blob/main/img/usb.png)

Each memory could be play 1 time or infinite time, with a delay. It is possible to stop the tranmission at any time, always by the central button of the keyer.

As usual, a settings menu allow you to manage brightness, screensaver, beep level, etc.

# Settings

First of all, format a micro SD card in FAT32. 

Then, using a plain text editor, you will create a file that should have the `.ini` extension. for example `IC705BT.ini` if you plain to use the ICKeyer with an IC-705 connect by Bluetooth. 

And now, here is what you will put in this `IC705BT.ini` :

```
; Icom Config
[icom]
icom_model = 705
icom_address = 0xA4
icom_connect = BT
icom_device = 30:31:7D:33:B2:58

; Wifi Config
[wifi]
wifi_ssid = YOUR_SSID
wifi_password = YOUR_PASSWORD

; Proxy Config
[proxy]
baud_rate = 115200
proxy_url = http://192.168.1.32
proxy_port = 1234
```

> This is a similar structure to the settings.h file you used to set up, but in plain text, using a .ini format.  

If you're using an IC-7300, here is an another example with this `IC7300USB.ini` :

```
; Icom Config
[icom]
icom_model = 7300
icom_address = 0x94
icom_connect = USB
icom_device = /dev/ttyUSB0

; Wifi Config
[wifi]
wifi_ssid = YOUR_SSID
wifi_password = YOUR_PASSWORD

; Proxy Config
[proxy]
baud_rate = 115200
proxy_url = http://192.168.1.32
proxy_port = 1234
```

> Important ! Important ! Important ! In USB mode, you need to use the [ICUSBProxy](https://github.com/armel/ICUSBProxy) version 0.0.6 or upper. 

Last, you will need to copy these files at the root of the micro SD Card. That's all.

> You are able to put multiple .ini settings files for all your transceivers. I have got 3 of them for my IC-705 in BT mode, my IC-705 in USB mode and my IC-7300 in USB mode. I put them in this repository. 

# Usage

At startup, you'll see the Ini Loader. Select the `.ini` file you would like to load and... enjoy. 

# Disclaimers 

Because of the systematic plundering of my open source projects by a minority of unscrupulous people, taking advantage of my work to make money, I decided to not open the source code of this project, for the moment.

I was insulted, threatened and blacklisted by these same people (resellers, youtubers, etc.). And even if I know that the majority is behind me, that's enough. 

I believe that a small part of the HamRadio community and some resellers are not yet mature enough to understand Open Source.

This being the case, I will make this firmware available for all, but...
